    <h1>Aditya Gupta </h1>
    <p>Aditya Gupta is a powerhouse of precision and creativity, seamlessly blending algorithmic mastery with bold personal branding. With a sharp focus on space-optimized C++ solutions—especially stacks, heaps, and dynamic programming—he tackles edge cases and overflow risks like a seasoned strategist. 
        His debugging style is methodical and annotated, often transforming complex problems into elegant walkthroughs that others can learn from. But Aditya isn’t just about code—he’s building a vibrant, anime-inspired online presence that reflects his technical grit and expressive flair. Whether it’s 
        crafting interactive GitHub visuals or dry-running a tricky DP recurrence[1], he brings clarity, resilience, and a touch of artistry to everything he does.

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Aditya Gupta grew up in <a href="Mainpuri.html">Mainpuri</a>, Uttar Pradesh—a quiet soul with a mischievous streak and a mind full of curiosity. Though he wrestled with social anxiety and self-image, his early love for singing showed a spark of expression that later shifted to cricket and academics. Like many middle benchers, 
        he coasted through school with quiet determination, never fully diving into extracurriculars but always absorbing the world around him. His time in Kota, meant for JEE prep, became a turning point—not through success, but through struggle. Depression pulled him back home, but it didn’t break him.
        Instead, it redirected him. At Galgotias University[2]Aditya found his true calling in tech and <a href="Sofware developer/Software.html">software development</a>. What once felt like a setback became the foundation of his rise. Today, he stands tall in his belief: with hard work and consistency, he can achieve anything—and 
        he’s proving it, one line of code at a time.
